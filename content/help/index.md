## Getting help in the course

I expect everyone will have questions at some point in the semester, so I encourage you to use the following resources for help: 

## Ask questions during class

If you have a question during class, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Student hours

I am here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend student hours during the times posted in the Syllabus to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Even if you donâ€™t know what your specific questions or points of confusion are, we can figure that out together. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

Student hours will be held in person (Segerstrom 112) and on Zoom, as well as one day a week in the APU Community Garden. Join using the Zoom link in [Canvas](https://canvas.apu.edu). You can find the office hours schedule on the [sylllabus page](https://apumath250.netlify.app/syllabus/) and in Canvas. 

## Campuswire

Outside of class and office hours, any questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com). The system is highly catered to getting you help quickly and efficiently from classmates and the instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor, you should post your questions on Campuswire. If you know the answer to a question posted by a classmate, I encourage you to respond! 

## Email 

If you have questions about personal matters that are not appropriate for the public forum on Campuswire (e.g. illness, accommodations, etc.), you may email Dr. Fitz at [kfitzgerald@apu.edu](mailto:kfitzgerald@apu.edu).
