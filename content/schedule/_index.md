## Course schedule by week

The following table provides links to all course assignments. 

Each week will include:

+ **Prepare**: watch videos and complete prep quiz by class time Tuesday (4:20pm)
+ **Application Exercise**: in-class together on Tuesdays, due at end of class (5:45pm)
+ **Lab**: in-class together on Thursdays, due class-time the following Thursday (4:20pm)
+ **Reading Annotations and/or Statistics Experience (SE)**: on your own, due Thursdays at class-time (4:20pm)

This course includes a final project, with scaffolded deadlines throughout the semester. We will have several in-class work sessions, but you are expected to complete a majority of the project with your team outside of class. 

Note that this schedule may be updated as the semester progresses, with all changes documented here.
