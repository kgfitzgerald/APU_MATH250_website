### Hardware

Students are expected to bring a laptop to all class sessions. If access to a laptop is an issue, then please contact the course instructor and an accommodation will be made. This requirement will not prevent students from taking this course. 

### Campuswire account

This term we will be using Campuswire as our preferred platform for questions about homework, labs, and general course questions. The system is highly catered to getting you help quickly and efficiently from classmates and the instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor, you should post your questions on Campuswire. See Canvas for Enrollment Code.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the semester, you will...

-   learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a reproducible and shareable manner
-   gain experience in data wrangling and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization
-   work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data
-   learn to effectively communicate results through written assignments and final project presentation

## Course design 

Much of the course design, activities, and assessments are adapted from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) curriculum and Duke University’s open source [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.introds.org) course under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International.

Modern data analysis is inherently tied to coding and computational tools, and coding is learned by doing. To facilitate this type of learning, this course utilizes a flipped learning design. Each week, you will watch a series of lecture videos and complete a preparation quiz before class. Then class-time will be dedicated to hands-on application exercises and group lab assignments. The activities and assessments follow a prepare, practice, perform format and are designed to help you develop the foundational skills of a modern data scientist. 

-   **Prepare**: Includes lecture videos and optional readings to introduce new concepts and a short quiz ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities.
-   **Practice**: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to apply the concepts and methods introduced in the lecture videos. The activities will be graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.
-   **Perform**: Includes labs, homework, one exam, and the final project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your ability to apply course material to analyze real-world data.

### Preparation Quizzes (Prepare)

At the beginning of each week, you will watch a series of lecture videos and take a low-stakes preparation quiz in Canvas to check your understanding. Each quiz can be re-taken up to 3 times before the deadline. The quiz is due by class-time on Tuesdays (4:20pm). 

### Application Exercises (Practice)

The majority of class-time on Tuesdays will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs) in RStudio Cloud, designed to help you practice the new skills, code, and concepts introduced in that week’s lecture videos. AEs are due by class-time on Thursdays the same week they are assigned. AEs are graded on completion; demonstrating that a good faith effort has been made on all parts of the assignment will earn full credit.  

### Labs (Perform)

The majority of class-time on Thursdays will be dedicated to team lab assignments. The labs are a more in-depth application of the week’s material that will have you complete scaffolded analyses of a real dataset using RStudio Cloud. Teams of 3 will be assigned by the instructor and will rotate approximately every two weeks. Labs are due by class-time the following Tuesday. The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.

### Homework (Perform)

Approximately every other week, an individual homework assignment will be due. Homework will be similar in nature to the labs but are to be completed on your own outside of class. You are still encouraged to work together, but homework will be submitted and graded individually. Homework will be assigned on Thursdays and due by class-time the following Thursday. The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.

### Exam (Perform)

There will be one take-home mid-term exam for you to demonstrate your individual ability to apply what you have learned. It will consist of an analysis and computational tasks related to the material in the prepare, practice, perform assignments. The exam is take-home and open-notes but must be completed individually, without discussing or seeking assistance from anyone inside or outside the course.

You will be given the opportunity to submit annotated test corrections to earn up to 1/3 of the points back on your exam. Specific instructions and expectations will be provided when the exams are graded and returned. 

### Statistics Experiences (Practice)

The world of statistics and data science is vast and dynamic! The goal of the statistics experience assignments is to help you engage with the statistics and data science communities outside of the classroom. There are a variety of ways you can participate in "Statistics Experiences”, which include but are not limited to listening to a podcast, reading a book, getting coffee with a statistician, joining the American Statistical Association, or participating in #TidyTuesday. Each experience is worth a varying number of points (see course website for details), and you are required to collect at least 5 "Statistics Experience points" throughout the semester. Up to 10 additional points can be collected and added to your lowest homework grade(s).

### Project (Perform)

The purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to investigate an interesting data-driven research question by analyzing a real-world dataset of your choosing. The project will be completed in self-assigned teams of 2-3. You will be asked to present your findings in a written report and an oral presentation. More details will be provided during the semester. 

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

<center>

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Prep quizzes                | 5%         |
| Application Exercises       | 3%       |
| Engagement & Participation  | 2%       |
| Statistics Experiences      | 5%       |
| Homework                    | 25%        |
| Labs                        | 20%        |
| Exam 01                     | 15%      |
| Final Project               | 25%        |

</center>

The final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

<center>

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |

| F            | \< 60              |

</center>

### Late work & extesion policies

The coding skills gained in this course build cumulatively week-by-week, so it is important to complete and submit all assignments on time. Due dates are there to help you keep up with course material and ensure you receive feedback in a timely manner. 

- Labs and homework may be turned in up to 3 days late, and there will be a 5% reduction for each 24 hour period the assignment is late. 
- Labs are intended to be completed in teams, and a majority of each lab will be completed in-class on Thursdays. If you are unable to attend a Thursday lab session, you must submit the assignment individually, and a 15% deduction will apply. 
- Late work will not be accepted for preparation quizzes or application exercises, as these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.
- There are no makeup exams unless specifically coordinated with the instructor in advance.  

### Waiver for extenuating circumstances 

Life happens, and there are sometimes extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing an assignment on time. The lowest homework and lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester to accommodate such circumstances. 

Additionally, you may request a waiver of the late penalty for one assignment. To do so, email the instructor in advance of the deadline, and the waiver will be granted, no questions asked. You may only request the waiver once, so only use it for truly extenuating circumstances. 

If there are life circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance or well-being, come talk to me, and we can work towards a solution and connect you to the support you need.
