### Software

This course will utilize the statistical software R and RStudio. Students will receive instructions in the first week of class for how download it onto their personal computer.

### Hardware

Students are expected to bring a laptop to all class sessions. If access to a laptop is an issue, then please contact the course instructor and an accommodation will be made. This requirement will not prevent students from taking this course.

## Course Communication

-   **Course website**: All lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on this course website, [apumath250.netlify.app](apumath250.netlify.app).
-   **Canvas** will be used to submit assignments and view grades as well as a HELP forum for outside-of-class questions.
-   **Email**: If you have a personal question that is not suitable for the public HELP forum (e.g. about your grade or a personal accommodation), you are welcome to email me directly. I do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening through Sunday.

## Course design

Much of the course design, activities, and assessments are adapted from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) curriculum and Duke University's open source [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.introds.org) course under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International.

Modern data analysis is inherently tied to coding and computational tools, and coding is learned by doing. To facilitate this type of learning, this course utilizes a flipped learning design. Each week, you will watch a series of lecture videos and complete a preparation quiz [*before*]{.underline} class on Tuesdays. Then class time will be dedicated to hands-on application exercises and group lab assignments. The activities and assessments follow a prepare, practice, perform format and are designed to help you develop the foundational skills of a modern data scientist. You will also *engage* with current events and issues of ethics in the data science community. 

-   **Prepare**: Includes lecture videos and optional readings to introduce new concepts and a short quiz to ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities.
-   **Practice**: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to apply the concepts and methods introduced in the lecture videos. The activities will be graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.
-   **Perform**: Includes weekly labs, one exam, and the final project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your ability to apply course material to analyze real-world data.
-   **Engage**: Includes weekly data ethics readings & community annotations as well as “statistics experience” points.

### Preparation Quizzes (Prepare)

At the beginning of each week, you will watch a series of lecture videos and take a low-stakes preparation quiz in Canvas to check your understanding. Each quiz can be attempted up to 3 times before the deadline, and your score will be the average of your attempts. The quiz is due by class-time on Tuesdays (4:20pm). 

### Application Exercises (Practice)

The majority of class-time on Tuesdays will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs) in RStudio, designed to help you practice the new skills, code, and concepts introduced in that week’s lecture videos. AEs are due at the end of class on Tuesdays and serve as your “exit ticket”. AEs are graded on completion; demonstrating that a good faith effort has been made on the assignment will earn full credit.  If you are unable to attend class on a Tuesday, you may still submit your AE for half credit. The two lowest AE scores will be dropped at the end of the semester to accommodate occasional absences.

### Labs (Perform)

The majority of class-time on Thursdays will be dedicated to lab assignments. The labs are a more in-depth application of the week’s material that will have you complete scaffolded analyses of a real dataset using RStudio. You will collaborate in randomly assigned teams of ~3, and teams will rotate approximately every 2 weeks. Labs are due by class-time the following Thursday. *The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*

### Exams (Perform)

There will be two exams for you to demonstrate your individual ability to apply what you have learned. Exams may include both an in-class and a take-home portion. The in-class exams will assess your conceptual understanding, and the take-home portions will consist of an analysis and computational tasks related to the material in the prepare, practice, perform assignments.

You will be given the opportunity to submit annotated test corrections to earn up to 1/3 of the points back on your exams. Specific instructions and expectations will be provided when the exams are graded and returned.

### Project (Perform)

The purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to investigate a real-world social good problem by analyzing a relevant dataset of your choosing. You will identify an issue you care about (e.g. mental health, food insecurity, animal adoption, mass incarceration) and find a dataset that allows you to better understand the problem and/or proposed solutions. The project will be completed in self-assigned teams of 2-3. You will be asked to present your findings in a written report and a poster presentation. See [Project](https://apumath250.netlify.app/project/) tab of course website for more details.


### Data Ethics Readings & Community Annotations (Engage)

Each week, you will read an article or book excerpt that engages with issues related to data ethics and/or data communication. You will engage with the reading via the community annotation tool Perusall. Annotations are due by class-time on Thursdays.


### Statistics Experiences (Engage)

The world of statistics and data science is vast and dynamic! The goal of the Statistics Experience assignments is to help you engage with the statistics and data science communities outside of the classroom. There are a variety of ways you can participate in "Statistics Experiences," which include but are not limited to listening to a podcast, reading a book, getting coffee with a statistician, joining the American Statistical Association, or participating in #TidyTuesday. Each experience is worth a varying number of points (see [here](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/APU_MATH_250/hw/se-01.html) for details), and you are required to collect at least 5 "Statistics Experience points" throughout the semester. Up to 10 additional points can be collected and added to your lowest homework grade(s).



## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

<center>

| Category                   | Percentage |
|----------------------------|------------|
| Prep quizzes               | 10%         |
| Application Exercises      | 5%         |
| Reading & Annotations      | 3%         |
| Statistics Experiences     | 2%         |
| Labs                       | 30%        |
| Exams                       | 10%        |
| Final Project              | 30%        |

</center>

<br>

The final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

<center>

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |

</center>

### Late work & extension policies

The coding skills gained in this course build cumulatively week-by-week, so it is important to complete and submit all assignments on time. Due dates are there to help you keep up with course material and ensure you receive feedback in a timely manner.

+ Late work will not be accepted for preparation quizzes or application exercises, as these are designed to help you prepare for the in-class labs each week.
+ All lab assignments will have a “Best By” date, meaning it’s best for your learning to submit them by the “Best By” date. For any lab assignment, you may submit a “Late work plan” form (available on Canvas) to propose an alternative submission date that is within one week of the Best By date. 
    - All reasonable requests will be honored, but you must submit your Late work plan PRIOR to the Best By date. 
    - Late work will not be accepted more than one week after the Best By date
    - To incentivize on-time work, you will have the opportunity to revise and re-submit any assignments that are turned in by the Best By date. A reasonable attempt needs to have been made on each problem in order to earn additional points on the re-submission. That is, it’s best to attempt each problem by the Best By date if you can, and it doesn’t have to be perfect on the first submission. 
+ Late exams will not be accepted unless specifically coordinated with the instructor in advance.

Incompletes are rare and are available only in “special or unusual circumstances” as negotiated with the instructor prior to the end of the term.  See the Catalog for policies regarding Withdrawals and grade record permanence.

If there are life circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance or well-being, come talk to me, and we can work towards a solution and connect you to the support you need.

## Course community and policies

### Inclusive community

It is my intent that this course models and fosters justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We will engage with these values both in content and in practice. Data and statistics can be tools to tell diverse stories and help us learn about the state of the world from a perspective beyond our own lived experience. When used responsibly and with integrity, they can amplify the experiences of vulnerable and historically excluded populations. For example, they can be used to shed light on disparities in our schools, healthcare system, and criminal justice system.

The research questions we ask, the data we collect, and the way we use that data are infused with (often hidden) values about who and what matters in the world. For example, we should examine if and when marginalized people and their experiences are being excluded from our data, particularly when that data is used in countless ways to drive decision-making and inform society about the state of the world.

You will be asked to continually and critically engage with these ideas with each dataset and analysis you encounter. You are expected to engage your peers and new perspectives with curiosity, empathy, and intellectual humility. It is my intent that all students be well-served by this course, that your learning needs are met inside and outside the classroom, and that the diversity that you bring to this class be valued and utilized as a resource and strength.

I (like many people) am continually learning how to honor diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by me or a peer) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. You will also have the opportunity to express concerns anonymously via check-in surveys. APU encourages community members to resolve conflicts directly, when possible. If an APU community member perceives that hostile words or behaviors were directed toward an individual or a group based upon that individual's or group's identity, they can submit a Bias Incident Report. Information on the reporting process is available on the website at www.apu.edu/diversity/bias/.

Affirming that diversity is an expression of God's image, love, and boundless creativity, it is APU's aim to collectively nurture an environment that respects each individual's uniqueness while celebrating our collective commonalities. It is in this spirit that we collectively strive to create an inclusive environment in which all students, staff, faculty, and administrators thrive.

### Faith Integration

Academic Faith Integration is recognized as an important feature of courses at APU. My identity as a Christ-follower shapes my worldview and therefore shapes my understanding of data and statistics. You can expect to discover how relevant themes from Christianity and data science meaningfully inform one another. I respectfully recognize that students come from a diversity of faith backgrounds and that they have a variety of perspectives. This diversity in perspective will be valued as a strength and resource that enriches the learning community.

### Academic integrity

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exam. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

Any violations in academic integrity standards as outlined in the [APU Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.apu.edu/provost/integrity/) and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of the Provost for further action.

### Accessibility & Support Services

If there is any portion of this class that is not accessible to you due to course format or challenges with technology, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations. If you have a disability that might prevent you from fully demonstrating your abilities, you should meet with an advisor in [Accessibility and Disability Resources](https://www.apu.edu/academic-success/services/accessibility/) as soon as possible to initiate disability verification and discuss reasonable accommodations that will allow the opportunity for full participation and for successful completion of course requirements.
