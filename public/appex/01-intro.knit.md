## What is data science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of <font class="vocab">mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science</font>."*

## Create a GitHub account

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). 

After you create your account, go to [bit.ly/sta199-github](https://bit.ly/sta199-github) and enter your Duke email address (NETID@duke.edu) and GitHub username. 
]

<small>
Some tips from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).
</small>

- <small>Incorporate your actual name!</small>
- <small> Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.<small> g., Twitter or Slack.</small>
- <small> Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.</small>
- <small> Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.</small>
- <small> Make it timeless.</small>
- <small> Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. `NA`).</small>

## Let's do an analysis!

- Let's take a look at the [UN Votes](https://sta199-fa20-002.netlify.app/appex/appex01-unvotes.html) analysis.

- Talk about the questions under the "Discussion" section in your breakout rooms. 

- We'll choose a few rooms to share their conclusions.
