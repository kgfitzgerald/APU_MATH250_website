## Coding style & workflow

- Avoid long lines of code. 
  - We should be able to see <u>all</u> of your code.
- Name code chunks.
- Knit, commit, and push regularly. 
  - Think about it like clicking to save regularly as you type a report.
- Label your code chunks. Do **not** put spaces in the code-chunk names.
