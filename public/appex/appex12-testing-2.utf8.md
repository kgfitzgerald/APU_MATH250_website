### From last class


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
```


```r
asheville <- read_csv("data/asheville.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   ppg = col_double()
## )
```

Suppose you are interested in whether the mean price per guest per night is actually less than $80. Conduct a hypothesis test to assess this claim.

**Hypotheses**

$H_0$: The mean price per guest per night is $80

$H_a$: The mean price per guest per night is less than $80

$H_0: \mu = 80$

$H_a: \mu < 80$

**Simulate null distribution**


```r
set.seed(092320)
```


```r
null_dist <- asheville |>
  specify(response = ppg) |>
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 80) |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```


```r
mean_ppg <- asheville |>
  summarise(mean_ppg = mean(ppg)) |>
  pull()
```

**Visualize Null distribution using ggplot**


```r
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_ppg, color = "red")
```

**Visualize null distribution using infer**


```r
visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = mean_ppg, direction = "less")
```

<img src="appex12-testing-2_files/figure-html/plot-null-infer-1.png" width="672" />

**Calculate p-value**


```r
null_dist |>
  filter(stat <= mean_ppg) |>
  summarise(p_value = n() / nrow(null_dist))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   p_value
##     <dbl>
## 1   0.316
```

**Conclusion**

The p-value 0.312 is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The data do not provide sufficient evidence that the mean price per night is less than $80. 


## Clone a repo + start a new project

Clone the **ae-12** repo on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sta199-fa20-002) and start a new project in RStudio. Be sure to configure git in the RStudio console, so you can so you can push your results back up to GitHub.

### Exercise 1

Suppose you are interested in whether at least half of the Airbnb listings in Asheville are more than $50 per guest per night. What would be your null and alternative hypotheses?

### Exercise 2

Simulate the null distribution to test your hypotheses. You can use 100 reps for the in-class exercise.


```r
#simulate null dist
```

### Exercise 3

What was your p-value? What decision do you make with respect to your 
hypotheses, and what conclusion do you make in the context of the research
problem?


```r
# calc p-value
```


### Exercise 4

Suppose you are interested in whether the proportion of listings with a price per guest per night greater than $50 is 0.5. How would your null and 
alternative hypotheses change in this case? Carry out the appropriate
hypothesis test, and report your p-value, decision, and conclusion in context of the research problem.
