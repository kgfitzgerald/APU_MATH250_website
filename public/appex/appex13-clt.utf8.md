### Project 
Introduce [project](https://sta199-fa20-002.netlify.app/project/)

### Tea with a TA 

Hang out with the TAs from STA 199! This is a casual conversation and a fun opportunity to meet the members of the STA 199 teaching time. The only rule is these can't turn into office hours! 

Tea with a TA counts as a statistics experience.

## Recap of CLT & Normal distribution

## Getting started 

Clone the **ae-13** repo and start a new project in RStudio. 

## AE 13: Bone density 

Suppose the mean bone density for a 65-year old woman is normally 
distributed with mean 809 mg/cm3 and standard deviation of 140 mg/cm3 (these are actually pretty accurate numbers).

### Exercise 1

What bone densities correspond to the 5th, 10th, 50th, and 99th percentiles of this distribution?

### Exercise 2

The densities of three woods are below:

- Plywood: 540 mg/cubic centimeter
- Pine: 600 mg/cubic centimeter
- Mahogany: 710 mg/cubic centimeter

What is the probability that a random 65-year old woman has bones less
dense than each of these three woods?

### Exercise 3

What is the probability that, for a *group* of 10 randomly sampled 65-year old women, the mean bone density of the *group* is less dense than these three woods?

### Exercise 4

Explain the differences between your answers in Exercise 2 and 3.
