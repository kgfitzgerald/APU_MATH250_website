### Tea with a TA 

Hang out with the TAs from STA 199! This is a casual conversation and a fun opportunity to meet the members of the STA 199 teaching team. The only rule is these can't turn into office hours! 

Tea with a TA counts as a statistics experience.

## Exercises 

For today's AE, we are analyzing the tweets from the statistics experience!

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
#library(wordcloud) #word cloud
```

```{r, eval = F}
tweets <- read_csv("data/stats-tweets.csv") |>
  mutate(tweet_num = 1:nrow())
```


### Exercise 1

Are these Tweets or Tweet threads? Let's see how long the statistics experience tweets are! 

### Exercise 2

Let's use the `unnest_tokens` to make a tidy data frame of words from the tweets. 


### Exercise 3

What are the most common words used in the tweets? Are the most common words interesting? If not, what can we do to make this more interesting? 

### Exercise 4

Make a graph to visualize the top 10 words from your tweets. 

### Exercise 5

Now let's see the general sentiment of the tweets. Use the bing lexicon to identify the top 10 most common words and their sentiments. 

### Exercise 6

Let's visualize the top 10 most common words for each sentiment. Make a plot to display the top 10 most commonly used positive words and negative words. 

### Exercise 7

We can also visualize the most common words using a word cloud. 

```{r}
#library(wordcloud)
#set.seed(10282020)
# _____ |>
#  anti_join(stop_words) |>
 # count(word) |>
#  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```

### Exercise 8

Based on this analysis, what are some general conclusions you draw about the class's first statistics experiences?
