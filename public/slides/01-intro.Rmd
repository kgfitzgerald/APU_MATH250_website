# Data Science

---

## What is data science?

- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

---

## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

<br>

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - While statistics $\neq$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is not your typical high school statistics course.

<br>

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes. We will use the computing language R.

---

## Course learning objectives

- Learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a *reproducible* and *shareable* manner

- Gain experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization

- Work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on *real-world questions* and data

- Learn to effectively communicate results through written assignments and final project presentation

---

## Some of what you will learn

.pull-left[
- Fundamentals of `R`

- Data visualization and wrangling with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from the `tidyverse`

- Web scraping

- Web based applications with `RShiny`

- Spatial data visualization

]

.pull-right[
- Data types and functions

- Version control with `GitHub`

- Reproducible reports with `R Markdown`

- Regression and classification

- Statistical inference
]
