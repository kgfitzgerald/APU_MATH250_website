```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r coffee-data}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 34152), rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 29712),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))
coffee_data = tibble(coffee = coffee, 
                     died = died)
```


Let A = died, B = non-coffee drinker (Does not drink coffee). Calculate the following for a randomly selected person in the cohort:

```{r prob-a}
#P(A)
```

```{r prob-b}
#P(B)

```

```{r}
#P(A and B)

```

```{r}
#P(A or not B)


```
