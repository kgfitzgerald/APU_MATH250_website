## Conditional probability

The probability an event will occur *given* that another event has already 
occurred is a .vocab[conditional probability]. The conditional probability of
event $A$ given event $B$ is:

.instructions[
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
]
---

## Conditional probabilities 

.instructions[
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
]

Examples come up all the time in the real world:

- *Given* that it rained yesterday, what is the probability that it will rain
today?
- *Given* that a mammogram comes back positive, what is the probability that a
woman has breast cancer?
- *Given* that I've already watched six episodes of How I Met Your Mother tonight,
what is the probability that I'll get any work done this evening?

## Coffee and mortality

```{r gunter, echo=FALSE, out.width = 700, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/07/coffee.png")
```

.midi[
```{r, echo = F}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 34152), rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 29712),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))
knitr::kable(table(coffee, died))
```
]

---

## Three probabilities

.midi[
```{r, echo = F}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 34152), rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 29712),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))
knitr::kable(table(coffee, died))
```
]

<br> 

.question[
.midi[
Define events *A* = died and *B* = non-coffee drinker. Calculate the following for a randomly selected person in the cohort:]
- .vocab[Marginal probability]: $P(A)$, $P(B)$
- .vocab[Joint probability]: $P(A \text{ and } B)$
- .vocab[Conditional probability]: $P(A | B)$, $P(B | A)$

# Independence

---

## The multiplicative rule

We can write the definition of condition probability

.instructions[
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$
]

--

.instructions[
Using the equation above, we get...

$$P(B) \times P(A | B) = P(A \text{ and } B)$$
]

.center[
**What does the multiplicative rule mean in plain English?**
]

---

## Defining independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be .vocab[independent] when


$$P(A | B) = P(A) \hspace{10mm} \textbf{OR} \hspace{10mm}
P(B | A) = P(B)$$

<br> 

In other words, knowing that one event has occurred doesn't cause us to "adjust"
the probability we assign to another event.

---

## Checking independence

We can use the multiplicative rule to see if two events are independent. 

.instructions[
If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then 

$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
]

---

## Independent vs. disjoint events

Since for two independent events $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$, knowing
that one event has occurred tells us nothing more about the probability of the
other occurring.

--

For two disjoint events $A$ and $B$, knowing that one has occurred
tells us that the other definitely has not occurred: $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$.

--

.instructions[
.center[
Disjoint events are **<u>not</u>** independent!
]
]

---

## Checking independence

```{r, echo = F}
coffee <- c(rep("Does not drink coffee", 6477), rep("Drinks coffee occasionally", 34152), rep("Drinks coffee regularly", 28535))
died <- c(rep("Died", 1039), rep("Did not die", 5438), 
          rep("Died", 4440), rep("Did not die", 29712),
          rep("Died", 3601), rep("Did not die", 24934))
knitr::kable(table(coffee, died))
```

Are dying and abstaining from coffee independent events? How might we check?

# Bayes' Rule

---

## An example

In an introductory statistics course, 50% of students were first years, 30% were
sophomores, and 20% were upperclassmen.

80% of the first years didn’t get enough sleep, 40% of the sophomores didn’t get
enough sleep, and 10% of the upperclassmen didn’t get enough sleep.

.question[
What is the probability that a randomly selected student in this class didn’t
get enough sleep?
]

---

## Bayes' Rule

As we saw before, the two conditional probabilities $P(A | B)$ and $P(B | A)$ 
are not the same. But are they related in some way?

--

Yes they are (!) using .vocab[Bayes' rule]:

.instructions[
**Bayes' rule:**

$$\begin{align}P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\\[10pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{align}$$
]

---

## Bayes' Rule (continued)

Putting together a few rules of probability...

$$\begin{align}P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\\[10pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}\\[15pt]
&= \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | A^c)P(A^c)}\end{align}$$

Let's took at an example to see how this works.

# Diagnostic Testing

---

## Definitions

Suppose we're interested in the performance of a diagnostic test. Let $D$ be
the event that a patient has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the
test is positive for that disease.

- .vocab[Prevalence]: $P(D)$
- .vocab[Sensitivity]: $P(T | D)$
- .vocab[Specificity]: $P(T^c | D^c)$
- .vocab[Positive predictive value]: $P(D | T)$
- .vocab[Negative predictive value]: $P(D^c | T^c)$

.question[
What do these probabilities mean in plain English?
]

---

## Rapid self-administered HIV tests

.pull-left[
From the FDA package insert for the Oraquick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody
Test, 
- Sensitivity, $P(T | D)$, is 99.3%
- Specificity, $P(T^c | D^c)$, is 99.8%
From CDC statistics in 2016, 14.3/100,000 Americans aged 13 or older are HIV+.
]

.pull-right[
```{r fda2, echo=FALSE, out.width = 400, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08/oraquick.png")
```
]

.question[
Suppose a randomly selected American aged 13+ has a positive test result. What is the probability they have HIV?
]

---

## Using Bayes' Rule

\begin{align*}
P(D | T) &= \frac{P(D \text{ and } T)}{P(T)}\\
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T)}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T | D)P(D) + P(T | D^c)P(D^c)}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{P(T | D)P(D)}{P(T | D)P(D) + (1 - P(T^c | D^c))(1 - P(D))}
\end{align*}

## A discussion

Think about the following questions:

- Is this calculation surprising?
- What is the explanation?
- Was this calculation actually reasonable to perform?
- What if we tested in a different population, such as high-risk individuals?
-  What if we were to
test a random individual in a country where the prevalence of HIV is approximately 25%?
