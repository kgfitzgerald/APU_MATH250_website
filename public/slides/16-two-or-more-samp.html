## Is yawning contagious?

An experiment conducted by the MythBusters tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns.

https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious-2

---

## Study description

In this study 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a control group where they didn't see someone yawn (control).


```r
yawn %&gt;% #in the openintro package
  count(group, result)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 3
##   group result       n
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24
## 4 trmt  yawn        10
```

---

## Proportion of yawners

.small[

```r
yawn %&gt;%
  count(group, result) %&gt;%
  group_by(group) %&gt;%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
## # Groups:   group [2]
##   group result       n p_hat
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12 0.75 
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4 0.25 
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24 0.706
## 4 trmt  yawn        10 0.294
```
]

- Proportion of yawners in the treatment group: `\(\frac{10}{34} = 0.2941\)`
- Proportion of yawners in the control group: `\(\frac{4}{16} = 0.25\)`
- Difference: `\(0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441\)`
- Our results match the ones calculated on the MythBusters episode.

---

## Independence?

.question[
Based on the proportions we calculated, do you think yawning is really contagious, i.e. are seeing someone yawn and yawning dependent?
]


```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
## # Groups:   group [2]
##   group result       n p_hat
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12 0.75 
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4 0.25 
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24 0.706
## 4 trmt  yawn        10 0.294
```

---

## Dependence, or another possible explanation?

- The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn 
and yawning are dependent.

- But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be **due to chance**.

- Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results.

- So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens.

- Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will **simulate** our results.

---

## Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Null hypothesis

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious (i.e., seeing someone yawn makes you more likely to yawn), and observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Alternative hypothesis

## Permuting yawn data 

Remember, under `\(H_0\)`, there is no association between yawning and seeing someone else yawn (i.e. control vs. treatment group.)

If there truly is no association, then shuffling whether someone was in the control or treatment group wouldn't matter -- we would expect similar proportions of 
people who yawn in each experimental group.

We will do this shuffling again and again, calculate the difference in proportion for each simulation, and use this as an approximation to the null distribution.

---

## Permuting yawn data

This distribution approximates all the possible differences in proportion we  could have seen if `\(H_0\)` were in fact true. We then use this distribution to obtain the probability that we see our observed data (or more extreme) -- the 
.vocab[p-value].

Here we sample without replacement; we merely permute the treatment labels of each of our outcomes.

## Conclusion

What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?
]

class: middle, center

## Comparing three or more groups

---

## An old example...

&lt;img src="img/07/coffee.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

| Coffee             | Died  | Did not die  |
| ------------------ |------:| ------------:|
| Non-drinker        | 1039  | 5438         |
| Occasional drinker | 4440  | 29712        |
| Regular drinker    | 3601  | 24934        |

We have more than two samples! Non-coffee drinkers, occasional drinkers, and
regular drinkers.

.vocab[
Is there an *association* between coffee drinking *status* and whether somebody
died? Are the two **independent**?
]

---

## A new hypothesis test...


| Coffee             | Died  | Did not die  |
| ------------------ |------:| ------------:|
| Non-drinker        | 1039  | 5438         |
| Occasional drinker | 4440  | 29712        |
| Regular drinker    | 3601  | 24934        |

- `\(H_0\)`: Coffee-drinking category and mortality are independent; there is no
association between the two variables
- `\(H_1\)`: Coffee-drinking category and mortality are NOT independent; there is
an association between the two variables

---

## Review

| Coffee             | Died  | Did not die  |
| ------------------ |------:| ------------:|
| Non-drinker        | 1039  | 5438         |
| Occasional drinker | 4440  | 29712        |
| Regular drinker    | 3601  | 24934        |

If two events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are .vocab[independent], then 
`\(P(A) \times P(B) = P(A \cap B)\)`. 

If `\(H_0\)` were true, then we would expect:
- P(Non-Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Died) = P(Non-drinker AND Died)
- P(Occasional Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Died) = P(Occasional drinker AND Died)
- P(Regular Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Died) = P(Regular drinker AND Died)
- P(Non-Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Lived) = P(Non-drinker AND Lived)
- P(Occasional Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Lived) = P(Occasional drinker AND Lived)
- P(Regular Drinker) `\(\times\)` P(Lived) = P(Regular drinker AND Lived)

---

## Observed vs. expected counts

| Coffee             | Died  | Did not die  |
| ------------------ |------:| ------------:|
| Non-drinker        | 1039  | 5438         |
| Occasional drinker | 4440  | 29712        |
| Regular drinker    | 3601  | 24934        |

If two events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are .vocab[independent], then 
`\(P(A) \times P(B) = P(A \cap B)\)`. 

Let's investigate non-coffee drinking and dying:

- P(Non-Drinker) = 6477/69164 `\(\approx\)` 0.09365
- P(Died) = 9080/69164 `\(\approx\)` 0.13128

If these were independent, we would *expect* P(Non-Drinker AND Died) to be
6477/69164 `\(\times\)` 9080/69164 `\(\approx\)` 0.01229. So, we expect approximately 
850 study participants to be non-drinkers who died.

The *observed* number is 1039, for a difference of 189 participants between
the observed and expected counts.

.question[
Is this strong evidence against independence?
]

---

## Observed vs. expected counts

Well, that was just one cell! There are five more cells in which there may be
differences between observed and expected counts.

.question[
How can we sum up these differences in a principled way, and use it to conduct statistical inference?
]

---

## The chi-square test

The chi-squared test has a very nice motivation in terms of comparing observed
vs. the expected counts that we would expect if `\(H_0\)` were true. If these
total differences are "large enough," then we reject the null hypothesis.

- To combine differences across table cells, we need to square them before adding 
them up (so that
negative differences aren't canceled out by positive differences)

- We will also scale these differences by the expected count (a 
difference of 189 participants isn't large when thinking about 100,000 total 
observations, but is huge when thinking about 300 total observations!)

---

## The chi-square test statistic

The chi-square `\(\chi^2\)` test statistic is

`\begin{align*}
\sum_{i \in {cells}}^{r \times c} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i},
\end{align*}`

where `\(r \times c\)` is the number of cells in the table (rows times columns), 
`\(i\)` indexes across all cells, `\(O_i\)` is the expected count in cell `\(i\)`, and
`\(E_i\)` is the expected count in cell `\(i\)`.

This statistic is the total squared difference between the observed and expected
cell counts, scaling by the expected cell count for each cell.

Under `\(H_0\)`, the distribution of this sum is approximated by a `\(\chi^2\)` 
distribution with `\((r - 1) \times (c - 1)\)` degrees of freedom.

---

## Chi-squared distributions

&lt;img src="img/16/chisquared.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Remember, we only reject if the difference is "large enough." So, we only 
examine the *right-tail*. That is, the probability of seeing our `\(\chi^2\)` 
statistic *or larger* when calculating p-values.

---

## Implementation in R

Luckily, you don't have to calculate all the expected counts by hand, create
the test statistic, and manually compare to a chi-square distribution.




```r
coffee_data %&gt;%
  slice(1:10)
```

```

##    &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;        
##  1 Does not drink coffee Died

##  9 Does not drink coffee Died         
## 10 Does not drink coffee Died
```

## Chi-square test using infer

Luckily, you don't have to calculate all the expected counts by hand, create
the test statistic, and manually compare to a chi-square distribution.

  chisq_test(formula = health_status ~ coffee)
```

## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   statistic chisq_df  p_value
##       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      55.2        2 1.05e-12
