## Is yawning contagious?

An experiment conducted by the MythBusters tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns.

## Study description

In this study 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: **34** to a group where a person near them yawned (.vocab[treatment]) and **16** to a control group where they didn't see someone yawn (.vocab[control]).

--

```{r}
yawn %>% #in the openintro package
  count(group, result)
```

---

## Proportion of yawners

.small[
```{r}
yawn %>%
  count(group, result) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```
]

--

- Proportion of yawners in the treatment group: $\color{#00b3b3}{\frac{10}{34} = 0.2941}$

--
- Proportion of yawners in the control group: $\color{#00b3b3}{\frac{4}{16} = 0.25}$

--

- Difference: $\color{#00b3b3}{0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441}$

---

## Independence?

.question[
Based on the proportions we calculated, do you think yawning is really contagious, i.e. are people who see someone yawn more likely to yawn themselves?
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
yawn %>%
  count(group, result) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```

---

## Dependence, or another possible explanation?

- The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn 
and yawning are dependent.

--

- But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be **due to chance**.

--

- Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results.

--

- So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens.

--

- Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will .vocab[simulate] our results.

---

## Two competing claims

--

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are .vocab[independent], yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ .vocab[Null hypothesis]

--

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are .vocab[dependent], yawning is contagious (i.e., seeing someone yawn makes you more likely to yawn), and observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ .vocab[Alternative hypothesis]

## Let's simulate the null distribution...

```{r}
set.seed(102020)
null_dist <- yawn %>%
  specify(result ~ group, success = "yawn") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps  = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("trmt", "ctrl"))
```


---

## Let's simulate the null distribution...

```{r eval = F}
set.seed(102020)  #<<
null_dist <- yawn %>%  #<<
  specify(result ~ group, success = "yawn") %>%

  generate(reps  = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("trmt", "ctrl"))

## Permuting yawn data 

Remember, under $H_0$, there is no association between yawning and seeing someone else yawn (i.e. control vs. treatment group.)

--

If there truly is no association, then shuffling whether someone was in the control or treatment group wouldn't matter -- we would expect similar proportions of 
people who yawn in each experimental group.

--

We will do this shuffling again and again, calculate the difference in proportion for each simulation, and use this as an approximation to the null distribution.

---

## Permuting yawn data

This distribution approximates all the possible differences in proportion we  could have seen if $H_0$ were in fact true. 

--

We then use this distribution to obtain the probability that we see our observed data (or more extreme) -- the 
.vocab[p-value].

--

Here we sample without replacement; we merely permute the treatment labels of each of our outcomes.

---

## Visualizing the null distribution

.question[
What would you expect the center of the 
null distribution to be?
]

--

```{r out.width="65%", echo = F}
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Simulated Null distribution", 
       x = "Simulated difference in proportions (pt - pc)")
```

---

## Calculating the p-value

```{r}
null_dist %>%
  filter(stat >= 0.0441) %>%
  summarise(p_value = n()/nrow(null_dist))
```

---

## Conclusion

.question[
What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test? Do you "buy" this conclusion?

We will manually run the permutation simulation in the live lecture session.
