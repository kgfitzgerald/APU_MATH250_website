## Vocabulary

- .vocab[Response variable]: Variable whose behavior or variation you are trying 
to understand. 

- .vocab[Explanatory variables]: Other variables that you want to use to explain
the variation in the response. 

- .vocab[Predicted value]: Output of the **model function**

- .vocab[Residuals]: Shows how far each case is from its predicted value
   - **Residual = Observed value - Predicted value**

## The linear model with multiple predictors

- Population model:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_1 + \beta_2~x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k~x_k $$

--

- Sample model that we use to estimate the population model:
  
$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x_1 + b_2~x_2 + \cdots + b_k~x_k $$

---


## Data and Packages

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo = F }
sports_car_prices <- read_csv("data/sportscars.csv")
```

Recall the file `sportscars.csv` contains prices for Porsche and Jaguar cars for sale on cars.com.

`car`: car make (Jaguar or Porsche)

`price`: price in USD

`age`: age of the car in years

`mileage`: previous miles driven

---

## Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
m_int <- lm(price ~ age + car + age * car, 
            data = sports_car_prices) 
m_int |>
  tidy() |>
  select(term, estimate)
```

$$\widehat{price} = 56988 - 5040~age + 6387~carPorsche + 2969~age \times carPorsche$$

## The linear model with multiple predictors

Population model:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_1 + \beta_2~x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k~x_k $$

Sample model that we use to estimate the population model:
  
$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x_1 + b_2~x_2 + \cdots + b_k~x_k $$


Similar to other sample statistics (mean, proportion, etc) there is variability
in our estimates of the slope and intercept.

.question[
- Do we have convincing evidence that the true linear model has a non-zero slope?
- What is a confidence interval for the population regression coefficient?
]

## Mileage vs. age

We will consider a simple linear regression model predicting mileage using age. 

.midi[
```{r}
m_age_miles <- lm(mileage ~ age, data = sports_car_prices)
```
]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(sports_car_prices, 
       aes(x = age, y = mileage)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Mileage")

```

## Confidence interval

.alert[
$$point~estimate \pm critical~value \times SE$$
]

--

.alert[
$$b_1 \pm t^*_{n-2} \times SE_{b_1}$$
where $t^*_{n-2}$ is calculated using a $t$ distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.
]

---

## Tidy confidence interval

```{r}
tidy(m_age_miles, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

---

## Calculating the 95% CI manually

A 95% confidence interval for $\beta_1$ can be calculated as

--

```{r}
(df <- nrow(sports_car_prices) - 2)
```

--

```{r}
(tstar <- qt(0.975,df))
```

--

```{r}
(ci <- 3837 + c(-1,1) * tstar *403)
```

---

## Interpretation 

```{r}
tidy(m_age_miles, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) |> 
  filter(term == "age") |>
  select(conf.low, conf.high)
```

.vocab[We are 95% confident that for every additional year of a car's age, the 
mileage is expected to increase, on average, between about 3030 and 4643 miles.]

## Hypothesis testing for $\beta_1$

Is there convincing evidence, based on our sample data, that age is 
associated with mileage?

We can set this up as a hypothesis test, with the hypotheses below.

--

.alert[
$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$. The slope is 0. There is no relationship between mileage and age. 

$H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0$. The slope is not 0. There is a relationship between mileage and age.
]

--

We only reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$ if the data provide strong evidence
that the true slope parameter is different from zero. 

---

## Hypothesis testing for $\beta_1$

```{r}
tidy(m_age_miles)
```

--

$$T = \frac{b_1 - 0}{SE_{b_1}} \sim t_{n-2}$$

--

The p-value is in the output is the p-value associated with the two-sided hypothesis test $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0$. 


---

## Hypothesis testing for $\beta_1$

```{r}
tidy(m_age_miles)
```

.vocab[The p-value is very small, so we reject] $\color{#1689AE}{H_0}$. .vocab[The data provide sufficient evidence that the coefficient of age is not equal to 0, and there is a linear relationship between the mileage and age of a car.]  
---

## Final Thoughts

We used a CLT-based approach to construct confidence intervals and perform 
hypothesis tests. 

Note that you can also use simulation-based methods to do inference using `infer`. [Click here](https://infer.netlify.app/articles/observed_stat_examples.html#two-numerical-vars---slr) for examples.

## Conditions for Inference in Regression

---

## Conditions

- **Linearity**: The relationship between response and predictor(s) is linear

- **Independence**: The residuals are independent

- **Normality**: The residuals are nearly normally distributed

- **Equal Variance**: The residuals have constant variance


---

## Conditions

- .vocab[L]**inearity**: The relationship between response and predictor(s) is linear

- .vocab[I]**ndependence**: The residuals are independent

- .vocab[N]**ormality**: The residuals are nearly normally distributed

- .vocab[E]**qual Variance**: The residuals have constant variance

--

<br> 

*For multiple regression, the predictors shouldn't be too correlated with each 
other.*


---

## `augment` data with model results

- `.fitted`: Predicted value of the response variable
- `.resid`: Residuals

.midi[
```{r}
m_age_miles_aug <- augment(m_age_miles)
m_age_miles_aug |>
  slice(1:3)
```
]

--

We will use the fitted values and residuals to check the conditions by 
constructing .vocab[diagnostic plots].

---

## Residuals vs fitted plot

Use to check .vocab[**L**inearity] and .vocab[**E**qual variance.]

.midi[
```{r, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(m_age_miles_aug, mapping = aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lwd = 2, col = "red", lty = 2) +
  labs(x = "Predicted Mileage", y = "Residuals") 
```
]

---

## Residuals in order of collection

Use to check .vocab[**I**ndependence]

.midi[
```{r, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(data = m_age_miles_aug, 
       aes(x = 1:nrow(sports_car_prices), 
           y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lwd = 2, col = "red", lty = 2) +
  labs(x = "Index", y = "Residual")
```
]

---

## Histogram of residuals

Use to check .vocab[**N**ormality]

.midi[
```{r fig.height= 1.75}
ggplot(m_age_miles_aug, mapping = aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) + labs(x = "Residuals")
```
]
