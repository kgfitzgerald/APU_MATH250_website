Daisy Silver,Minoan Fertility Goddess Figurines,2017,NA,"Set of seven ceramic figurines of varying sizes. Recreations of artefacts from ancient cultures. Awarded University of Edinburgh Acquisition Award 2017 All seven pieces were created with terracotta clay by coil building and were glazed. The colour of the glazes and the poses of the figures were inspired by real historic artefacts. For example, the red figurine is inspired by ‘Terracotta model of a woman seated at an oven, 500 BC’ displayed in the British Museum. Red was a colour normally reserved for male flesh but the figure was perhaps painted red because she is watching a loaf of bread bake in an oven. The poses of these seven figures were inspired most directly from Syrian artefacts 1100 BC, Iron Age II figures from the Bethlehem tomb 7th c BC and Cypriot figures 1700-1200 BC. Accompanying text upon installation reads: Minoan Fertility Goddess Figurines Excavated in 1967 from a sanctuary site outside of Akrotiri, Santorini (1700 - 1400 BCE) Associated with the practises of mystery cult ritual, these figurines were left as votive offerings by girls as a coming of age ceremony before marriage. The island of Santorini was a major centre of trade, which developed into a pilgrimage site for peoples in the Minoan cultural sphere. The range of glaze colours and poses of the figurines are a result of the diverse groups that travelled to this sanctury site. The more reserved poses are associated with the peoples of Santorini, while the female empowerment stances are attributed to Crete. The blue gaze later developed as an attempt to mimic the colour of the semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli that was introduced to the Cylades as a result of intense contact with Phoenician traders. These later figurines manifested as physical depictions of goddesses instead of simply votive.",ceramic (material)/clay/inorganic material/materials (substances),Figure 1: Figure 2: Figure 3: Figure 4: Figure 5: Figure 6: Figure 7:,Art Collection; Edinburgh College of Art,sculpture; sculpture,NA,EU5592,https://collections.ed.ac.uk/art/record/100015?highlight=*:*,NA,NA
Daniel Cook,The King and I,2017,NA,"Artist's statement: The King and I was the development of a short film initially shown at the Talbot Rice Gallery as part of the Edinburgh College of Art MFA Contemporary Art Interim Show in May 2016. It gave the viewer a taste of the premiere to be shown at the ECA degree show in May 2017. The film is a documentary giving a glimpse of the life of Graham Croan Bee, a well-known eccentric and artist based in Edinburgh’s New Town. The documentary is framed inside Graham’s home; a place that runs on a time zone different from the rest of society. Upon entering one is transported into Graham’s environment which he has carefully constructed resembling an exotic grotto; it is Graham’s world. Two other characters also have been a main influence on the documentary: Barrett, who made a brief appearance during the initial stages of filming, and Juliette, Graham’s closest friend. As an ongoing project the film went through many different phases of documentary and profilmic experimentation before culminating into a taster, a brief glimpse of Graham’s life in 2016. The nature of the project has been to work experimentally with collaboration, performance and documentary. The use of these techniques — specifically, the profilmic aspects in cinematography such as cinema verite; mise en scenes and experimental interviews — has aided me in developing my practice as both filmmaker and artist. They are central to the overall development of the video and project, they inspired my academic research in the field of documentary and filmmaking. I visited Barrett (one of Graham’s lodgers and friends) whilst he was living in Graham’s guest room. Having been evicted from his flat in Leith he was dealing with many complex personal issues and self-medicating with alcohol. Barrett offered me a tour of the house which I captured surreptitiously on a hand held camera. As a gesture of welcome Barrett offered me a mysterious spirit in one of his recycled bottles and so began the documentary. In those moments the shakily-held hand camera captured natural light and shady corners of the corridors and kitchen as I followed Barrett, crashing around from one room to the next, occasionally stopping to discuss the various aspects of Graham’s character and possessions. During one of the visits to the house it occurred to me that whilst still developing a relationship with both Graham and Barrett, it was very difficult to get the coverage I wanted due to the chaotic nature of both their lives. Frustratingly, on several occasions opportunities were missed to capture some exciting moments. On one such occasion, Barrett had been in a confrontation over the ownership of his flat in Leith which culminated in a fight involving the police. The following morning, due for court Barret was accompanied by Graham, minus the slightly dishevelled faces they both appeared immaculately dressed. It was the fleeting moments like this that I was disappointingly unable to capture. Later Barrett showed me his battered hand and bruised legs recounting the tale of when he had been hit with a hammer by his lodger. In November 2015 Graham disappeared for two months. In his absence Barrett watched over the house while preoccupied with some promiscuous visitors that came and went. During that time a series of escalating events led to visits from the police, and eventually led to him vacating the property for a rehab programme. The house remained unattended for months. It wasn’t until later when Graham returned, looking rather brown from the tanning beds and everything was seemingly back to normal, that we decided to seriously pursue shooting a film. Barrett was omitted from the edit due to his absence and instead I met Graham’s friend Juliet. Juliet holds many similar interests and beliefs to Graham and all three of them at one point had intertwined histories, she often stepped in when things had got out of hand. Our first meeting had been arranged to visit one of her properties in the New Town. Before entering the building I could spot Juliet’s old bashed up green station wagon, that was haphazardly parked on the street outside. The building’s exterior was adorned by overgrowth and had an old Georgian façade; the interior was classically dressed in ornate furnishings and a grand chandelier hung in the central hall. This contrasted with Juliet whom I met standing in the stairwell with her Pug called Bella carried under one arm. Her style, much like Graham’s was very eclectic — sporting myriads of golden jewelry and thick makeup. She wore a glamourous fur jacket with some more casual garments underneath including a pair of leopard print leggings and pink kitsch trainers. The chat was fast paced and stories were turned over quickly as they had a ‘catch up’. The two hit it off with their banter and I immediately saw the potential for involving her in the film. She was very keen and well-spoken, having previously been educated at Fettes. She was a well-connected character but with a down to earth Edinburgh charm about her. During the project, she provided many engaging moments and openly shared her relationship with Graham on camera. I’m grateful for her involvement and could not have completed the film without it. Another important collaborator I would like to mention was the Curator, James Clegg. He helped adapt some scripted dialogue within the film. The words were then vocalised by the singer/songwriter Fae Fife from The Rezillos punk band. The soundtrack was created by my brother Fergus Cook who is a musician and producer also tied together the final film. This with the scripted dialogue created the feeling of fluidity throughout the video, while giving the vague experience of performance. The fascinating backdrop of Graham’s house was difficult to capture and to recreate the true experience of being there in person amongst his mass of furnishings and objects. I felt restricted by the single screen projection as I wanted to show the complicated and unusual nature of Graham’s environment, alongside engaging with his character on screen. Using a two-panel diptych composed of two 16:9 screens I gave the film a cinematic quality with an almost panoramic grandeur and scale. This became the permanent format for the video. In some cuts we watch an intimate moment with Graham as the other camera wanders around the house in search of other parts of his ambiguous character. Books, objects, antiques, plant arrangements, pictures and photographs, combined with the cramming of furnishings, alter and change the space, robbing it of time and perspective. In other sections of the video I used two cameras to film one scene from two different perspectives opening up the scenes for multiple analysis. The plurality of the two screens give the feeling of a more staged performance as it heightens the atmosphere theatrically. It de-personalises the reality of the characters into that of actors. At this point I was drawn to performance and the ‘performative reality’ surrounding The King and I.",NA,NA,Art Collection; Edinburgh College of Art,NA,NA,EU5600,https://collections.ed.ac.uk/art/record/100021?highlight=*:*,NA,NA
Daniel Hughes,Red Faced,2014,NA,"The expression on the bright red plaster ‘face’ is unnervingly elusive.
