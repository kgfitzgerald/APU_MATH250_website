<h2 id="activities--assessment">Activities &amp; Assessment</h2>
<p>The activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the <strong>Prepare, Practice, Perform</strong> format.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare</strong>: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and a short quiz to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perform</strong>: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the final project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prep-quizzes-prepare">Prep quizzes (Prepare)</h3>
<p>These are low-stakes quizzes that will be completed at the beginning of each unit (about once per week) as part of the preparation for lecture. These quizzes include multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. Each quiz will be administered in Sakai and may be taken up to three times. The quiz is due by the beginning of lecture on the specified due date. An overall score of 80% on all quizzes will result in full credit for prep quizzes in the final course grade.</p>
<h3 id="application-exercises-practice">Application Exercises (Practice)</h3>
<p>A majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.</p>
<p>Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.</p>
<p>In addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.</p>
<h3 id="labs-perform">Labs (Perform)</h3>
<p>In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team&rsquo;s Git repository on the course&rsquo;s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member&rsquo;s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using R Markdown, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.</p>
<p><em>The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
<h3 id="homework-perform">Homework (Perform)</h3>
<p>In homework, you will apply what you&rsquo;ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using R Markdown and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.</p>
<p>One homework assignment will be dedicated to a <em>statistics experience</em>. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you&rsquo;re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.</p>
<p><em>The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
<h3 id="exams-perform">Exams (Perform)</h3>
<p>There will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you&rsquo;ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.</p>
<h3 id="final-project-perform">Final Project (Perform)</h3>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="/project/">final project</a> is to apply what you&rsquo;ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.</p>

<p>If there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Professor Tackett before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.</p>
<p>If there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Professor Tackett know if you need help contacting your academic dean.</p>
<h3 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h3>
<p>Regrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.</p>
<p><em>No grades will be changed after the final project presentations.</em></p>
