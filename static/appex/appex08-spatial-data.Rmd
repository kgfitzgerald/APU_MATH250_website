## Which visualization do you prefer? 

Below are two maps showing the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases as of August 30, 2020. The maps are snapshots of the interactive visualization on [www.sharedgeo.org/COVID-19](https://www.sharedgeo.org/COVID-19/).

If you're doing an analysis to understand COVID spread in the US, which map do you prefer? Why? Place your vote and reasoning on Ed Discussion: https://edstem.org/us/courses/8027/discussion/613213
