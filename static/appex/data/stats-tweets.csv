"Matty Pahren, statistics major at Duke University, meets with students to discuss learning pathways and possibilities. Focuses on interdisciplinary potential and overcomes barrier of physical distance to establish personal connection!"
"Statistics can be a pathway for exploring the fields you are passionate about! From finance to music to medicine, statistical modeling is a powerful tool. After Tea with a TA with Matty Pahren, I will definitely explore Bayesian statistics in medical data. #ModelingisforEveryone"
Just learned that the ability to make decisions with statistical inference thinking is not unique to humans and primates!
"Coronavirus Statistics create a cycle between people and data. We decide what statistics to promote and influence policy, but statistics influences what actions we take to keep ourselves safe and how we ultimately change the trends in data."
Learned more about the Presidential Race today with Mike Traugott. It was interesting to see the shifts in public opinion regarding the parties overtime. Also learned how important it is to recognize the limitations of visualizations. The most critical message from today: #VOTE!
"Just listened to the Stats + Stories ""Observing Extreme Environmental Events"" podcast...sometimes you actually want to look at outliers, but too bad the public likes to misconstrue your results. Tough."
"Good news! 538 says Dems have 58% chance of flipping Senate! Model is super robust with elements like incumbency and was adapted from 2018 midterms with more weight on state partisanship. Silver says model doesn‚Äôt tell us everything though, so be sure to vote!"
"This podcast combined data science and politics to give us a series of predictions of the outcomes and trends of the various elections coming up in the 2020 election cycle based on polling, most notably the presidential race, but also the various House and Senate races."
Statistics are truly more than batting averages and free throws. They help you understand the world around you to a greater degree. And that's the TEA (with a TA)
I had a great time attending the Uconn Sports Analytics Symposium! The presentations were interesting and insightful and really helped me learn more about the industry. I can‚Äôt wait to go again and learn even more next year!
"I learned a lot about FiveThirtyEight's election prediction model and the different inputs it uses (and which inputs it chooses to ignore as well). I also learned about what the model thinks about the current election situation, where it's favoring Biden to win."
The electoral college can make or break an election - even when the popular vote is in favor of the candidate who doesn't win the electoral college... but we all know this. We saw this in 2016!
"Just listened in on the ""A Winning Formula"" podcast from statsandstories.net - I'm truly amazed by the extent to which statistics are being used in the sports world in the modern era and how sophisticated sports analysis programs are becoming! Potential career, maybe?"
According to the 2020 forecast model done by FiveThirtyEight Biden has a 71% chance of winning the election! The exact same percentage calculated for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chances in 2016. Coincidence or fate? Can the statistics be trusted or is there too much uncertainty?
"Listened to a Stats + Stories podcast today and learned to be careful of Coronavirus headlines and corresponding visualizations. A reminder to always look at the sample because data can be misleading‚Ä¶ Also, be wary of the color red! (232 characters)"
We need to be curious when approaching statistics and transparent when presenting statistics. Both of these tactics will help ourselves and others better understand the world and better appreciate statistics.
"After listening to the podcast ""Messaging Medicine,"" I learned about the origins of public distrust in science. In order to decrease scientific distrust, there needs to be more approachable overlap between public and scientific conversation."
"If you need a look behind all of the crazy political headlines, listen to FiveThirtyEight's Model Talk podcast to see a data-driven approach to figuring out our next batch of leaders. It looks like the Dems have a decent shot of taking the Senate back, but nothing is certain."
"The study of statistics is no joke, but that doesn't mean humor can't be used to present important scientific and mathematical data to a general audience."
"I had a great time listening to the most recent ModelTalk podcast hosted by @NateSilver and @GalenDruke from FiveThirtyEight! Learned some of the background statistics around the polls, and it definitely eased some of my election anxiety."
"Listened to 538‚Äôs podcast today that modeled Biden‚Äôs double digit lead with mail in voting, early voting, turnout, and ballot damage all factored in. It was a very comprehensive listen!"
The FiveThirtyEight podcast not only discussed incredibly interesting questions about the election but showed how relevant data analysis is to everyday life #dataiscool
Just listened to this incredible podcast by Stats + Stories. It gave wonderful insight into how we think about data and algorithms. There were even a few jokes sprinkled in. 100% would recommend.
"After listening to A Winning Formula for Sports, I learned that baseball is the leading sport in the use of statistical analytics to inform their decision making. Better statistical can be the determining factor of a team‚Äôs win or loss."
"If you want to use statistics in the real world, be sure to learn both Python and R!! There are many jobs popping up in the statistics field, and experience with both of these languages will definitely help you find one!!"
"I listened to 538 talk about their 2020 presidential election forecast model. I now better understand the components of models, and data science‚Äôs application to politics. I look forward to learning about more predictive models in the future."
"I attended the #ICPSR webinar on ""The 2020 Presidential Race Mid-Campaign"" led by @MikeTraugott. I learned a lot about what voters stances are on certain issues and how it relates to each presidential candidate; It was informative and entertaining. Prof. Traugott did a great job!"
Key takeaways from Dr. Frank Harrell‚Äôs appearance on the highly informative Stats + Stories podcast: 1. Precision medicine is often over-hyped 2. Be wary of machine learning NOT done well 3. Poor experiment design and p-hacking are major contributors to the reproducibility crisis

"Interesting podcast about statistics used in medicine. Interview of Dr. Frank Harrell, founding chair of Vanderbilt Biostatistics Dept. New perspective on biostatistics jobs? Yes."
Did you know that statistical data can be used to enact real life change? Researchers at the University of Michigan found out that middle-aged adults with preexisting conditions are more likely to develop Alzheimer‚Äôs. That info can be used for future policy and medical research!
Just attended prof. Roger‚Äôs talk on statistics in the media! The media can‚Äôt be trusted! They always skew the results and rarely show the true reason behind why things happen! Feeling skeptical and betrayedüßê
"Listen people, a lower p-value threshold isn't always better! Sometimes it is worth it to make mistakes if the cost of no discovery is high enough. The important thing is that we always recognize that scientific results are provisional and we should view them with healthy skepticism."
FiveThirtyEight's podcast on the future of COVID raises multiple concerns about how to predict transmission/death rates. Mandatory mask/social distancing policies combined with the easing of nationwide lockdowns make it hard to infer about what lies ahead. #themoreyouknow
"Former 76ers Director of Analytics, Aaron Barzilai, didn't have a degree in statistics and still was a founding influence of data science within the NBA. He paved the way for thousands to shoot their own shot and dribble into the world of basketball analytics."
"Watched the Model Talk podcast about the upcoming presidential election‚Äì it really clued me into how much uncertainty there is in stats. There's so much we don't know, so we have to hope we have enough data to make significant predictions!"
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks about love in terms of numbers and probability. Love is complicated and confusing, and somehow being able to think about it quantitatively makes it a little less confusing."
"For my statistics experience, I listened to the podcast, ‚ÄúBig Data and Big Laughs,‚Äù an interview with Comedian/Data Scientist Timandra Harkness. I think comedy and data science both stem from the same essential question: how can we make sense of an uncertain world?"
"It‚Äôs been a great experience to join two meaningful, data-driven panels about data quality challenges in the 2020 census. Great insight and real-life applications to know, and hopefully it will help us solve the issues for a better purpose. #ICPSRdatafair #2020census #datascience"
"I listened to three Duke stat alum discuss their jobs. All three apply stats in different ways, but they agreed that ability to continue to learn and having strong collaborative and networking skills are the key to success at any job. I was very interested in how there was much more to their jobs than hard-coding numbers into models."
I learned a great deal about statistics application through the ICPSR webinar about administrative claims datasets and analytic approaches for physically disabled individuals.  #statsapplication #ICPSR2020 #virtuallearning

You‚Äôre isolating high risk groups with your headlines. Don‚Äôt make them feel like the ‚Äúother‚Äù- we‚Äôre all in this together.
"Tea with Ezinne was great! Chill time, learned a little more about her life, her study abroad program at Cambridge, the applications of stats in body cam compliance rates, ‚Ä¶ Gave good college and life advice! Thanks for the talk Ezinne :)"
Empowered by strong women using data to help society and change the world! #WomenInTech #EthicalData
"Listening to the Observing Extreme Environmental podcast episode from Stats + Stories taught me a lot about how data science can be applied to real world situations. It demonstrated the importance of understanding what the statistics actually mean within the context of the subject, in this case climate change. It made me think about the way society thinks about statistics and the importance of making clear claims about statistics that explain what they truly represent. One part that struck me was the idea that scientists can only collect and present the data, but then it is up to society to take this information and make changes from there. "
AWESOME talk by Dr. Lloyd Talley on intra-categorical approaches to intersectionality that CHALLENGE the common statistical assumption of homogeneity among young Black men: Social positions are not additive; unique social position subgroups need to be ACCOUNTED FOR in datasets!
"I learned about predicting political elections with statistical models and the uncertainties surrounding them given current events. Such predictions are never completely accurate, and anything can happen especially in today's crisis-stricken world. "
"Statistical Models predicting the presidential election are so complex, so relevant, and so intriguing. It was interesting to learn about what each model represents as well as how different scenarios can influence this model over time. Excited to see if the model is correct!"
Yes Biden is leading by a lot in the current 2020 Election. No it is not as simple as it may seem. Polling/election prediction is a complicated phenomenon and there are many variables in play that can affect the results. Don‚Äôt just listen to the polls though => VOTE VOTE VOTE!
"Thanks to the team of statisticians who gave an informative talk on cannabis data and public health and social equity issues. Found their discussion of the relationship between cannabis, criminalization and community particularly interesting - keep up the great work!"

"Dr.Traugott‚Äôs presentation, The 2020 Presidential Race Mid-Campaign, was incredibly interesting as he presented numerous graphs and charts about data relating to the presidential race. Some of the topics covered consisted of poll demographics, candidates‚Äô basic strategies, and data visualizations based on public opinion."
"Just watched 538s podcast explaining how their election predicting model works! Super interesting to see how they factor in so many different variables into their model, especially with Covid 19 being a part of the equation. I recommend it for everyone! #538 #election #statistics"
I just learned a ton about how to advance my data science skills to become more marketable and create stunning visualizations!
"Watched FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs podcast on how presidential forecasts work! Brings up lots of cool ideas like what factors affect forecasting models, how COVID-19 and the economy shape predictions, linear regression, and where the uncertainty lies in forecasting. Cool stuff! "
"Talked about educational backgrounds, different clinical studies, and statistical tests with a really cool biostatistician who works at Duke Clinical Research Institute, who is also my mom! "
I've learnt to make a conscious decision to pay closer attention to the way number are used to quantify aspects of human life.
"The webinar held by the ICPSR was insightful and eye-opening. The importance of collecting accurate data, especially after natural disasters and pandemics cannot be emphasised enough. Given that the survey ended a few days ago and the large number of disruptions this year, it will be interesting to see the results of the survey."
The podcast that I listened to on risk assessment models was an insightful review of the ways supposedly objective models of statistics are integrated into our society. This podcast shows why it‚Äôs important to understand the ethics of data science. 
"just had lunch with my professor, who talked about using statistics to determine the probability of someone getting strangled. data science and statistics really are everywhere!"
FiveThirtyEight team discusses factors contributing to inc in democrat's chance of winning the Senate. Differences between state and national presidential election polls are highlighted. 
"Let's talk about sext, baby: the importance of data collection, and realizing its limitations, in an environment driven by funding. In order to answer new and important questions we must work to  diversify the information at hand."
"Data science isn‚Äôt just for people interested in statistics ‚Äì it can appeal to a wider audience, especially through comedy! Data can be very useful, but don‚Äôt only rely on data or algorithms for answers. It‚Äôs important to use your own thoughts and think about the context too."
That moment when Elo ratings predict a Lakers loss. The bubble really is a special place ü§©  #feeltheHeat #respectthenumbers
Had a really great conversation and learned a lot about the applications of statistics with my TA! 
"attended the ""Segregation within Integrated Schools: Racially Disproportionate Student- Teacher Assignments in Middle Schools"" ... and there's a lot of work to be done"
Loved talking to @ezinne_nwa today about her career in data science and life as a graduate student at @DukeUniversity. It was very inspiring and helpful as I continue to figure out my own career path!
"Model Talk broke down what was going on behind the statistics into colloquial language and analyzed what it means for this election season. Answering questions and discussing potential changes, this both informed me of statistical use in elections and current electoral data."
The public needs to understand what experts are finding out about the environment! Uncertainty does not mean unlikely! We can already do things like extrapolating data from extreme values. The public should know what this means so they can help fight against climate change!
"Don't believe everything you see on this app! Media companies are prioritizing immediacy of information instead of factuality of information. They are competing for your attention and time, and couldn't care less about how well informed you are! #Sad #Disappointing"
"In episode 7 of Stats+Stories, Rick Ludwin, a former NBC executive, talks about the significance of TV ratings and why networks make the choices that they do. He also talks about ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show‚Äù hosts he has encountered in his long career and addresses the growth of streaming."
"Dr. Frank Harrell, a biostatistician at Vanderbilt, explains how research biases impact our medical care and how capitalism influences medical statistics. Main takeaway: it is important to always look beyond the surface of the stats with a healthy sense of skepticism!"

Stites also talks of the importance of good statistics understanding as a news writer.
Found this episode of @FiveThirtyEight's #ModelTalk episode intriguing. Who knew that we truly know so little about the Alaska race because of robo polling. Looking forward to seeing how @NateSilver and team adjust the forecast as the the race culminates with this hectic climate...
"Election models faced sharp criticism in 2016 after Trump‚Äôs improbable win. Interesting to see that even after conservative choices in modeling, Biden is significantly leading national polls by 10+ points. The data collection and complexity of analysis is ü§Ø. #Election #Vote üá∫üá∏"
I love how statistics provides so much insight that can indirectly and directly help improve our daily lives!
