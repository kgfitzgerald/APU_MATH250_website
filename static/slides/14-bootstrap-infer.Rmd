# Bootstrapping with infer

## Package `infer`

.pull-left[

[infer.netlify.app](https://infer.netlify.app/index.html)
]

.pull-right[
The objective of package `infer` is to perform statistical inference using an 
expressive statistical grammar that coheres with the tidyverse design framework.

```{r}
library(infer)
```

## Set a seed

Let's set a seed

```{r eval = F}
set.seed(123)
```

`set.seed()` is an R function that allows us to control R's random number generation. Use this to make your simulation work reproducible.

In other words, it ensures we'll get the same random sample each time we run the code or knit.

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
abb |>
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = ppg) #<<
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
abb |>
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = ppg) |> 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") #<<
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
abb |>
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = ppg) |> 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") |> 
  # calculate the statistic of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "mean") #<<
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
```

```{r}
num_reps <- 15000
```

```{r}
# save resulting bootstrap distribution
boot_dist <- abb |> #<<
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = ppg) |> 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = num_reps, type = "bootstrap") |> 
  # calculate the statistic of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

---

## Sample means

How many observations are there in `boot_dist`? What does each observation 
represent?

--

```{r}
boot_dist
```

---

## Visualize the bootstrap distribution

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
boot_dist_plot <- ggplot(data = boot_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution centered around 75",
       x = "Price per guest", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

boot_dist_plot
```

---

## Calculate the confidence interval

A 95% confidence interval is bounded by the middle 95% of the bootstrap 
distribution.

```{r}
boot_dist |>
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

---

## Visualize the confidence interval

```{r echo=FALSE}
lower_bound <- boot_dist |> 
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025)) |> 
  pull()

upper_bound <- boot_dist |> 
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975)) |> 
  pull()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
boot_dist_plot + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), 
             color = "skyblue", size = 2)
```

---

## What the interval tells us

- The population parameter is either in our interval or it isn't. It can't have a
"95% chance" of being in any specific interval.

--

- The bootstrap distribution captures the variability of the sample mean, but is
based on our original sample. If we started with a different sample,then maybe our estimated 95% confidence 
interval would have been different also.

--

- All we can say is that, if we were to independently take repeated samples from
this population and calculate a 95% CI for the mean in the exact same way, then
we would *expect* 95% of these intervals to contian the population mean.

--

- However, we never know if any particular interval(s) actually do!

---

## Recall: Interpretation 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
boot_dist_plot + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), 
             color = "skyblue", size = 2)
```

**We are 95% confident that the mean price per night for Airbnbs in Asheville, NC is between $ `r round(lower_bound,2)` and $ `r round(upper_bound,2)`. **
