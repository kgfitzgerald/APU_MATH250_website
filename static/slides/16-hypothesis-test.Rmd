## How can we answer questions using statistics?

.question[
**Statistical hypothesis testing** is the procedure that assesses
evidence provided by the data in favor of or against some claim
about the population (often about a population parameter or
potential associations).
]

---

## The hypothesis testing framework

.center[
```{r, out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE}
# Small fig.width
include_graphics("img/16/pius.jpg")
```
] 

.question[
*Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat*
]

---

## The hypothesis testing framework

1. Start with two hypotheses about the population: the null hypothesis and the 
alternative hypothesis.

--

2. Choose a (representative) sample, collect data, and analyze the data.

--

3. Figure out how likely it is to see data like what we observed, **IF** the 
null hypothesis were in fact true.

--

4. If our data would have been extremely unlikely if the null claim were true, 
then we reject it and deem the alternative claim worthy of further study. 
Otherwise, we cannot reject the null claim.

## Organ donation consultants

.center[
```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE}
# Small fig.width
include_graphics("img/16/agnew_clinic.jpg")
```
] 

<!-- People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special  -->
<!-- medical consultant. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the  -->
<!-- surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the  -->
<!-- medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part  -->
<!-- on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients. -->

---

## Organ donation consultants

One consultant tried to attract patients by noting that the average complication 
rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only 
had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She 
claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to 
reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).

.question[
Is this a reasonable claim to make?
]

rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only 
had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She

.question[

1. Start with two hypotheses about the population: the null hypothesis and the 
alternative hypothesis.

2. Choose a (representative) sample, collect data, and analyze the data.

3. Figure out how likely it is to see data like what we observed, **IF** the 
null hypothesis were in fact true.

4. If our data would have been extremely unlikely if the null claim were true, 
then we reject it and deem the alternative claim worthy of further study. 
Otherwise, we cannot reject the null claim.

---

## Two competing hypotheses

The null hypothesis (often denoted $H_0$) states that "nothing unusual is 
happening" or "there is no relationship," etc.

On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis (often denoted $H_1$ or $H_A$) 
states the opposite: that there *is* some sort of relationship.

.question[
In statistical hypothesis testing we **always** first assume that the null 
hypothesis is true and then evaluate the weight of proof we have against
this claim.
]

---

## 1. Defining the hypotheses

The null and alternative hypotheses are defined for **parameters** not 
statistics.

.question[
What will our null and alternative hypotheses be for this example?
]

--

- $H_0$: the true proportion of complications among her patients is equal to the 
US population rate
- $H_1$: the true proportion of complications among her patients is **less** 
than the US population rate

Expressed in symbols:

- $H_0: p = 0.10$
- $H_1: p < 0.10$

where $p$ is the true proportion of transplants with complications among her
patients.

---

## 2. Collecting and summarizing data

With these two hypotheses, we now take our sample and summarize the data.

The choice of summary statistic calculated depends on the type of data. In our 
example, we use the sample proportion: $\widehat{p} = 3/62 \approx 0.048$:

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

Next, we calculate the probability of getting data like ours, *or more extreme*, 
if $H_0$ were in fact actually true.

This is a conditional probability: 
> Given that $H_0$ is true (i.e., if $p$ were *actually* 0.10), what would 
> be the probability of observing $\widehat{p} = 3/62$?"

.question[
This probability is known as the **p-value**.
]

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

Let's simulate a distribution for $\hat{p}$ such that the probability of 
complication for each patient is 0.10 for 62 patients. 

This **null distribution** for $\hat{p}$ represents the distribution of the 
observed proportions we might expect, if the null hypothesis were true.

.question[
When sampling from the null distribution, what is the expected proportion of
complications? What would the expected count be of patients experiencing 
complications?
]

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 2.5}
set.seed(1)

n_sims <- 1
boot_dist = numeric(n_sims) 

for(i in 1:n_sims){

  sim_dat <- sample(outcomes, size = 62, prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE) 
  boot_dist[i] <- sum(sim_dat == "complication") / 62 
} 

boot_props = tibble(boot_dist)

  geom_vline(xintercept = 3/62, lwd = 2, color = "red")
```

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

Supposing that the true proportion of complications is 10%, if we were to take
repeated samples of 62 liver transplants, about 11.5% of them would have 3 or
fewer complications.

That is, **p = 0.115**.

---

## 4. Making a conclusion

If it is very unlikely to observe our data (or more extreme) if $H_0$ were 
actually true, then that might give us enough evidence to suggest that it is
actually false (and that $H_1$ is true).

What is "small enough"? 
- We often consider a numeric cutpoint (the **significance level**) defined 
*prior* to conducting the analysis.
- Many analyses use $\alpha = 0.05$. This means that if $H_0$ were in fact true, 
we would expect to make the wrong decision only 5% of the time. 

If the p-value is less than $\alpha$, we say the results are 
**statistically significant**. In such a case, we would make the decision to 
**reject the null hypothesis**.

---

## What do we conclude when $p \ge \alpha$?

If the p-value is $\alpha$ or greater, we say the results are not statistically 
significant and we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. 

Importantly, we never "accept" the null hypothesis -- we performed the analysis
assuming that $H_0$ was true to begin with and assessed the probability of 
seeing our observed data or more extreme under this assumption.

---

## 4. Making a conclusion

.question[
There is *insufficient* evidence at $\alpha = 0.05$ to suggest that the 
consultant's complication rate is less than the US average.

## Vacation rentals in Asheville, NC


.center[
```{r, out.width = "45%", echo = FALSE}
# Small fig.width
include_graphics("img/16/asheville.jpg")
```
] 

.question[
Your friend claims that the mean price per guest per night for Airbnbs in 
Asheville, NC is $100. What do you make of this statement?
]

---

## 1. Defining the hypotheses

Remember, the null and alternative hypotheses are defined for **parameters,**
not statistics

.question[
What will our null and alternative hypotheses be for this example?
]

- $H_0$: the true mean price per guest is $100 per night
- $H_1$: the true mean price per guest is NOT $100 per night

Expressed in symbols:

- $H_0: \mu = 100$
- $H_1: \mu \neq 100$

where $\mu$ is the true population mean price per guest per night among Airbnb
listings in Asheville.

---

## 2. Collecting and summarizing data

With these two hypotheses, we now take our sample and summarize the data. We 
have a representative of 50 Airbnb listings in the file `asheville.csv`.

The choice of summary statistic calculated depends on the type of data. In our 
example, we use the sample proportion, $\bar{x} = 76.6$.


```{r}
asheville <- read_csv("data/asheville.csv")

asheville |> 
  summarize(mean_price = mean(ppg))
```

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

We know that not every representative sample of 50 Airbnb listings in Asheville
will have exactly a sample mean of exactly $76.6. 

.question[
How might we deal with this **variability** in the **sampling distribution of the mean** 
using only the data that we have from our original sample?
]

--

We can take **bootstrap samples**, formed by sampling *with replacement* from
our original dataset, *of the same sample size* as our original dataset.

```

---

## Shifting the distribution

We've captured the variability in the sample mean among samples of size 50 from
Asheville area Airbnbs, but remember that in the hypothesis testing paradigm,
we must assess our observed evidence *under the assumption that* $H_0$ *is true*.

```{r, eval = T}
boot_means |> 
  summarize(mean(stat))
```

.question[
Where should the bootstrap distribution of means be centered under $H_0$?
]

---

## Shifting the distribution

```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 2.5}
set.seed(12345)
library(infer)

boot_means <- asheville |>

---

## 3. Assessing the evidence observed

Supposing that the true mean price per guest were $100 a night, about 0.16% of
bootstrap sample means were as extreme or even more so than our originally
observed sample mean price per guest of $76.6.

That is, **p = 0.0016**.

---

## 4. Making a conclusion

If it is very unlikely to observe our data (or more extreme) if $H_0$ were 
actually true, then that might give us enough evidence to suggest that it is
actually false (and that $H_1$ is true).

.question[
There is sufficient evidence at $\alpha = 0.05$ to suggest that the mean price 
per guest per night of Airbnb rentals in Asheville is not $100.
]

---

## Ok, so what **isn't** a p-value?

> *"A p-value of 0.05 means the null hypothesis has a probability of only 5% of* 
> *being true"* 

> *"A p-value of 0.05 means there is a 95% chance or greater that the null*
> *hypothesis is incorrect"* 

--

# <center><span style="color:red">NO</span></center>

p-values do **not** provide information on the probability that the null 
hypothesis is true given our observed data.

---

## What can go wrong?

Remember, a p-value is calculated *assuming* that $H_0$ is true. It cannot be 
used to tell us how likely that assumption is correct. When we fail to reject 
the null hypothesis, we are stating that there is **insufficient evidence** to 
assert that it is false. This could be because...

- ... $H_0$ actually *is* true!
- ... $H_0$ is false, but we got unlucky and happened to get a sample that 
didn't give us enough reason to say that $H_0$ was false.

Even more bad news, hypothesis testing does NOT give us the tools to 
determine which one of the two scenarios occurred.

---

## What can go wrong?

Suppose we test a certain null hypothesis, which can be either true or false 
(we never know for sure!). We make one of two decisions given our data: either 
reject or fail to reject $H_0$. 

--

We have the following four scenarios:


| Decision             | $H_0$ is true | $H_0$ is false |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Fail to reject $H_0$ | Correct decision    | *Type II Error*  |
| Reject $H_0$         | *Type I Error*  | Correct decision     |

- $\alpha$ is the probability of making a Type I error. 
- $\beta$ is the probability of making a Type II error.
- The **power** of a test is 1 - $\beta$: the probability that, if the null
hypothesis is actually false, we correctly reject it.
